IoTE is the next generation IoT Explorer platform with privacy, Secure, fast and Strong scalability for smart IoT applications and ecosystems.

Top Ten Highlights of IoTE (IE)
 
1.	With the IoTE, Internet of Things Explorer platform, early participation is always encouraged as it is beneficial. This is because usually, the first (six) stages that makes up the block award are made out into halves each six months that passes;  

2.	As the IoTE is user oriented, it introduces the Masternode network where the user who is the node builder would get up to 35 percent of the revenue from rewards made by the block;

3.	IoTEâ€™s original CryptoVantaa algorithm is CPU friendly,GPU resistant and ASIC resistant;

4.	The POW utilizes CPU mining and amazingly, developers have made sure that its threshold is low enough to accommodate wide participation by any and everyone who wishes to use it;

5.	IoTE ensures effective operation of P2P networks by the combination of the PoW+iPoS hybrid consensus mechanism;

6.	The explorer makes use of amazing albeit innovative decentralized management proposal systems that helps to certify and solidify the future DAPP ecological construction;

7.	With the advent of blockchain tech, the combination of blockchain and IoT helps solve the difficulties associated with different commercial structures in place and of course, creates new structures for future users;

8.	The IoTE comes with second to none privacy features that are in built hence users can decide to be anonymous and can be privately searched;

9.	IoTE envisages that the future will certainly be hinged on the DAG and IPFS technologies hence same has been incorporated to make sure that data can be stored properly and interactions can be done with speed;

10.	Finally, the IoTE has a peculiar design created to adapt complex applications envisaged in years to come. It has a multi-layer network structure and a loosely coupled modular design.

IoTE is certainly the next generation explorer platform and its developers have seen to it that the combination of unique features that promotes privacy and security makes it one force to be reckoned with.
